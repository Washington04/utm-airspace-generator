D1: established project. built grid (covered most of Western WA). readme, etc. 1000m cell size. Running 
and testing directly out of GH for now. 

D2: added license. tried to reduce grid cell size to 100m make it more realistic for drone deconfliction 
but this 100x'd the number of cells so I in order to reduce the overall area size I imported a geoJSON of 
Seattle city limits from https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/ and modified grid cell size to 500m 
for mvp. Worked great after some debugging. 

D3: Configured local dev environment in vs code and Github desktop. Added unique cell ids. Rounded cell centroids to 
nearest thousandth place. Timestamped local env outputs. 

D4: Created poi.csv and poi.geojson. Points of interest include 1 hub, 10 merchants, 10 customers. 
Intalled Geo Data Viewer for visualization in vs code. 

D5: Built flight generator and flight generator html visualization via Folium. Operational intent is vector based only. 
for now. Straight flight paths from hub-merchant-customer, then return to hub. 

N7 Roadmap:
- import FAA constraints and obstacle data. For example, default flight altitude is 250ft MSL despite 
downtown obstacles at 1100ft. 
- Consider converting to hex grid and reducing cell size to better enable deconfliction.
